# Grade Management

## Description
This project is a simple grade management system. It allows the user to generate
random grades for a number of students and then calculate the average grade.
The user can also ask for the students who have a grade above the average not 
only for the whole course but also for each subject. In this case, the functionality
is implemented for the English subject.
It is also possible to see students with the highest and lowest grades in Math.
